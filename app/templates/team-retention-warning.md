Your amazee.ai account has been inactive for 90 days
Hi {{name}},

We noticed you haven't used your amazee.ai account in about 90 days, and wanted to give you a heads up about what happens next.

**What's happening**: Your account will be deactivated in 2 weeks (around {{soft_delete_date}}) due to inactivity. If it stays inactive, we'll permanently delete all your data 60 days after that.

**Want to keep your account?** Just log in and use it. Any activity—running a query, creating a key, or using any of your AI services—resets the clock completely.

**What gets deleted:**
- Soft delete (in 2 weeks): Your account becomes inaccessible, but we keep your data for 60 more days in case you come back
- Hard delete (60 days later): Everything is permanently removed—users, keys, configurations, usage history, and any stored data

**Why we do this:** We take data privacy seriously. If you're not actively using amazee.ai, we don't want to hold onto your information indefinitely. This policy helps us keep your data safe and our systems clean.

**Have questions?** Reach out to us at ai.support@amazee.io—we're here to help.

Thanks for trying amazee.ai. We'd love to see you back.
—The amazee.ai team
